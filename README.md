# BlueBot

BlueBot is a two-wheel robot built using an Arduino Uno and controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth. This project was created as part of a student comprehensive examination in the engineering physics course to explore hands-on electronics, microcontroller programming, and Bluetooth communication. The robot can drive in four directions and is operated using simple commands sent from a phone or computer.

It uses an Arduino Uno compatible board, an L298N H-Bridge motor driver to control two DC motors, an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless input, and it is all assembled on an MDF laser-cut robot chassis with jumper wires. Power is supplied by a 9V battery to keep the robot mobile and untethered.

# BlueBot: Arduino Bluetooth Robot

BlueBot is a two-wheel robot built using an Arduino Uno and controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth. Developed as part of a student robotics internship, this project explores embedded systems, wireless communication, and motor control using basic components and a streamlined design.

## üì¶ Components

- Arduino Uno-compatible board
- L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- 2x 6V DC geared motors with rubber wheels
- MDF laser-cut robot chassis
- Jumper wires (male-to-female)
- 9V battery

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. Upload the Arduino sketch (coming soon).
2. Power the Arduino using a 9V battery via the barrel jack.
3. Connect to the HC-05 module using a Bluetooth terminal on a computer (iPhone not supported).
4. Send the following single-letter commands:
   - `F` ‚Äì Forward
   - `B` ‚Äì Backward
   - `L` ‚Äì Turn Left
   - `R` ‚Äì Turn Right
   - `S` ‚Äì Stop

## ‚úÖ Project Highlights

- Fully wireless movement via Bluetooth
- No breadboard or resistors needed in final design
- Compact and efficient layout with minimal wiring
- Successfully tested on different indoor surfaces
- Powered entirely by a single 9V battery

## üîß To Do

- Add ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection
- Upload final code and wiring diagram
- Add photos and videos of the robot in action

## üôå Credits

Thanks to our supervisor and teammates for support, testing, and build assistance!

Thank you to Joel Trudeau for organizing and providing us with necessary material! It was very fun to assemble and code.
