# BlueBot

BlueBot is a two-wheel robot built using an Arduino Uno and controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth. This project was created as part of a student comprehensive examination in the engineering physics course to explore hands-on electronics, microcontroller programming, and Bluetooth communication. The robot can drive in four directions and is operated using simple commands sent from a phone or computer.

It uses an L298N motor driver to control two DC motors, an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless input, and a breadboard with resistors to manage safe voltage levels. Power is supplied by USB power banks to keep the robot mobile and untethered.
